### Generation configurations ###
# Example for generation atomic crystals
# Rename this file to "cfg.yaml" for use

Crystal system: LaH10

Mode: atoms
Relaxation mode: vasp
# or vasp_fixed_and_unfixed if a two-stage relaxation is needed -- 
# first with fixed lanthanum positions, then without restrictions
VASP steps: 3
# number of relaxation stages with special settings from INCAR_i

# ATTENTION:
# You need to specify relaxation settings by redacting INCAR_i:
# -- in inputs/vasp/incar_unfixed if you use vasp relaxation mode
# -- in inputs/vasp/incar_fixed and inputs/vasp/incar_unfixed if you use vasp_fixed_and_unfixed relaxation mode
# You also need to download all the necessary POTCAR files corresponding to the types of atoms 
# in the initial environment and in the added environment to the inputs/vasp/potcars

Pressure (GPa): 0 
# Pressure = 0 GPa by default

Number of bins along each lattice vector:
    n_bins_x: 12
    n_bins_y: 12
    n_bins_z: 12
